In a kingdom by the sea 
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of ANNABEL LEE;

Than to love and be loved by me.
I was a child and she was a child 
In this kingdom by the sea;

And bore her away from me 
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea.

Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we-

And neither the angels in heaven above 
Nor the demons down under the sea 
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul

Went envying her and me-
