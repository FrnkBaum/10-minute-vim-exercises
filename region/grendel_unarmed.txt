HelTRASHSTUFFd him by the hand; hateful to other
WasTRASHSTUFF each one if living. A body-wound suffered
TheTRASHSTUFF direful demon, damage incurable
WasTRASHSTUFF seen on his shoulder, his sinews were shivered,
HisTRASHSTUFF body did burst. To Beowulf was given
GloTRASHSTUFFry in battle; Grendel from thenceward
MusTRASHSTUFFt flee and hide him in the fen-cliffs and marshes,
//Sick unto death, his dwelling must look for
//Unwinsome and woful; he wist the more fully
//The end of his earthly existence was nearing,
//His life-days’ limits. At last for the Danemen,
When the slaughteMORETRASHr was over, their wish was accomplished.
The comer-from-faMORETRASHr-land had cleansed then of evil,
Wise and valiant,MORETRASH the war-hall of Hrothgar,
Saved it from vioMORETRASHlence. He joyed in the night-work,
In repute for proMORETRASHwess; the prince of the Geatmen
ForXXXXX the East-Danish peopXXXXXle his boast had accomplished,
BetXXXXXtered their burdensomXXXXXe bale-sorrows fully,
TheXXXXX craft-begot evil theXXXXXy erstwhile had suffered
//And were foXXXXXXXXXrced to endure from crushing oppression,
