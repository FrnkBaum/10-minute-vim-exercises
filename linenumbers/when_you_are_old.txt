WHEN you are old and gray and full of sleep
   -> 12

And loved your beauty with love false or true; 
   -> 24

And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
   -> 39

And nodding by the fire, take down this book, 
   -> 21

Murmur, a little sadly, how love fled 
   -> 18

And paced upon the mountains overhead, 
   -> 9

And slowly read, and dream of the soft look 
   -> 30

But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, 
   -> 33

And bending down beside the glowing bars, 
   -> 15

Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep; 
   -> 36

And loved the sorrows of your changing face.
   -> 27

How many loved your moments of glad grace, 
   -> 6
