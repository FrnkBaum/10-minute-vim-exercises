WHEN you are old and gray and full of sleep
   -> 9
 
How many loved your moments of glad grace, 
   -> 36
 
And nodding by the fire, take down this book, 
   -> 24
 
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep; 
   -> 6
 
And paced upon the mountains overhead, 
   -> 27
 
And loved the sorrows of your changing face.
   -> 21
 
And bending down beside the glowing bars, 
   -> 30
 
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look 
   -> 12
 
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
   -> 39
 
Murmur, a little sadly, how love fled 
   -> 15
 
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, 
   -> 18
 
And loved your beauty with love false or true; 
   -> 33
