You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
   -> 20

I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
   -> 72

Out of the huts of history's shame
I rise
   -> 32

Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
Weakened by my soulful cries.
   -> 48

You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.
   -> 68

Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.
   -> 52

You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I'll rise.
   -> 88

Up from a past that's rooted in pain
I rise
   -> 8

Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
I rise
   -> 44

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
   -> 24

Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
   -> 64

Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard
   -> 76

Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
   -> 16

You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
   -> 28

I rise.
Maya Angelou - Still I Rise
   -> 0

I rise
I rise
   -> 60

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
   -> 84

Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
   -> 36

'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own back yard.
   -> 56

That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?
   -> 12

'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.
   -> 40

Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
   -> 80
