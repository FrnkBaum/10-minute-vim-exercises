Because I could not stop for Death--
He kindly stopped for me-- 
   -> 44

The Roof was scarcely visible-- 
The Cornice--in the Ground-- 
   -> 48

My labor and my leisure too, 
For His Civility-- 
   -> 32

We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain-- 
We passed the Setting Sun-- 
   -> 36

We slowly drove--He knew no haste 
And I had put away 
   -> 12

I first surmised the Horses' Heads 
Were toward Eternity-- 
   -> 24

We passed the School, where Children strove 
At Recess--in the Ring-- 
   -> 16

Or rather--He passed us-- 
The Dews drew quivering and chill-- 
   -> 52

We paused before a House that seemed 
A Swelling of the Ground-- 
   -> 8

The Carriage held but just Ourselves-- 
And Immortality.
   -> 20

Since then--'tis Centuries--and yet 
Feels shorter than the Day 
   -> 28

For only Gossamer, my Gown-- 
My Tippet--only Tulle-- 
   -> 40
