When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
   -> 21

Haply I think on theeâ€”and then my state,
   -> 42

   For thy sweet love rememb'red such wealth brings
   -> 36

Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
   -> 27

And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
   -> 24

With what I most enjoy contented least;
   -> 33

I all alone beweep my outcast state,
   -> 15

And look upon myself, and curse my fate,
   -> 45

Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
   -> 18

From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
   -> 9

Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
   -> 6

   That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
   -> 39

Like to the lark at break of day arising

Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
