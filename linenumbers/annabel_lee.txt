It was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea 
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of ANNABEL LEE;
   -> 12
 
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me.
I was a child and she was a child 
In this kingdom by the sea;
   -> 60
 
So that her highborn kinsman came
And bore her away from me 
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea.
   -> 36
 
That the wind came out of the cloud by night 
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we-
   -> 30
 
Of many far wiser than we-
And neither the angels in heaven above 
Nor the demons down under the sea 
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
   -> 54
 
The angels not half so happy in heaven 
Went envying her and me-
Yes!- that was the reason (as all men know 
In this kingdom by the sea)
   -> 24
 
In her tomb by the sounding sea.

And this was the reason that long ago 
In this kingdom by the sea 
A wind blew out of a cloud chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee;
   -> 18
 
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.
For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
   -> 66
 
But we loved with a love that was more than love-
I and my Annabel Lee;
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me.
   -> 48
 
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so all the night-tide I lie down by the side
Of my darling- my darling- my life and my bride 
In the sepulchre there by the sea 
   -> 42
