1   It was many and many a year ago
5   And this maiden she lived with no other thought
2   In a kingdom by the sea 
3   That a maiden there lived whom you may know
EXTRA LINE
4   By the name of ANNABEL LEE;
8   In this kingdom by the sea;
6   Than to love and be loved by me.
EXTRA LINE
7   I was a child and she was a child 
9   But we loved with a love that was more than love-
12  Coveted her and me.
10  I and my Annabel Lee;
EXTRA LINE
11  With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
16  My beautiful Annabel Lee;
13  And this was the reason that long ago 
14  In this kingdom by the sea 
EXTRA LINE
15  A wind blew out of a cloud chilling
17  So that her highborn kinsman came
20  In this kingdom by the sea.
18  And bore her away from me 
EXTRA LINE
19  To shut her up in a sepulchre
24  In this kingdom by the sea)
21  The angels not half so happy in heaven 
22  Went envying her and me-
EXTRA LINE
23  Yes!- that was the reason (as all men know 
25  That the wind came out of the cloud by night 
26  Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
28  Of those who were older than we-
EXTRA LINE
33  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.
27  But our love it was stronger by far than the love
EXTRA LINE
29  Of many far wiser than we-
30  And neither the angels in heaven above 
31  Nor the demons down under the sea 
32  Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
34  For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
EXTRA LINE
35  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
38  And so all the night-tide I lie down by the side
36  And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
EXTRA LINE
37  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
41  In her tomb by the sounding sea.
39  Of my darling- my darling- my life and my bride 
EXTRA LINE
40  In the sepulchre there by the sea
